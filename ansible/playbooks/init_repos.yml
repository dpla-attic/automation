# This playbook must be invoked with --extra-vars "level=<environment>".
# For example, --extra-vars "level=development".
# You also have to be sure you're passing ansible-playbook the correct inventory
# file with the -i option!

# To have this create the test API account, specify
# --extra-vars "create_test_account=true" to ansible-playbook.
# For example, --extra-vars "level=development create_test_account=true"
# This test account is useful in development or testing, because there are still
# automated tests that expect it to exist.

# After this playbook is run, you need to use the sync_couch_views.py module in
# the "ingestion" project to create CouchDB views in the various databases, and
# then run an ingest with other ingestion tools.

# Example invocation:
# $ ansible-playbook -u mb -i development playbooks/init_repos.yml \
#   --extra-vars "level=development create_test_account=true"
