### Upgrade PostgreSQL from 9.1 to 9.4 -- 2015-10
#

# This migration puts sites into maintenance mode, upgrades the PostgreSQL
# software, and then upgrades the system tables.  PostgreSQL system tables are
# not compatible between major versions (9.n and 9.n+1).  It then runs the
# `postgresql` role to configure what is actually a separate, new installation;
# and, finally, deletes the old version so that you don't have two versions
# of the database running at the same time.
#
# PLEASE SEE README-upgrade-2.2.0.txt FOR DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE
# UPGRADE.

# PERFORMING THE UPGRADE
#
# 1.  Make sure your packages and your configuration are up-to-date and
#     you don't get any errors running the "all" playbooks, e.g. dev_all.yml
#     or dev_ingestion_all.yml.  You can use the package_upgrade.yml playbook
#     to make sure your o/s packages have been updated.
#
# 2.  Run this playbook.  For example:
#     $ cd /path/to/ansible
#     $ ansible-playbook -u me -i ingestion \
#       playbooks/migrations/upgrade-postgresql-201510.yml \
#       -e 'level=development'

# ** Commandline variables **
#
# The following variables must be passed on the commandline.
# - level:  Environment "level," e.g. "development", "staging",
#           or "production".)  If you're unsure, you want "development".
#
# The following variables may be passed on the commandline.
# - upgrade_jobs: Number of concurrent upgrade processes. Recommended 1 per CPU.
#                 A degree of concurrency can speed up the upgrade.
# - purge: Whether to purge the old 9.1 installation and cluster from the
#          filesystem.
